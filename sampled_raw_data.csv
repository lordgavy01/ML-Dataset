Jason cut him off to ask if the device he was attempting to activate was a Verizon device. What he didn’t understand—-because my father didn’t get a chance to explain it—-was that the device is an unlocked Verizon phone.   Jason again interrupted and stated “That’s not what I asked you.”  My father immediately decided that he did not wish to work with Jason, and asked to speak to a tech, like he had scheduled to do.   Now, even if the device was not a phone that can be activated, how would the Jason have known that, without probing and listening to the customer? I have been in customer service for over 15 years, and my parents has been loyal Verizon customers for at least ten. They have NEVER been treated with such rudeness!

I called and waited on hold to talk to someone about delaying my bill as I am auto pay and it would not allow me to do this online.  Not only was I not told of the $7 fee for the financial customer service to do this and after I asked SEVERAL times so it would not be withdrawn per auto pay. I was told he took care of it and sent me this email as well as a text to verify it would not be withdrawn from my account until the 7th. Day before yesterday, I received another email thanking me for my payment as it was auto paid on the original date 29th and not what was agreed on. Plus the only thing customer service would say is we can return the payment but it will take up to 5-7 business days. Seriously!!!! I will be paying it in 7 days. Now not only was I charged the $7 for the supposed to cancel auto pay but the overdraft fees in my bank as the agreement made was not held up on Verizon end.  This has really put me in hardship as now not only am I overdrafted, the money Verizon said they would not take was the money I needed for other bills. So just to get out of the mess  I will probably need up with owing my bank around 80-100 dollars Oh yeah, did I forget to say last night after being in hold the first time for 20+ minutes when it said 11 minutes. The first lady said she was getting a supervisor and never came back after an hour another lady answered and stated she was not a supervisor but stayed on until was able to transferred. Now once supposedly supervisor came on (I will admit extremely frustrated but was not personally attacking him as I know he is not all at fault) but he literally drop the call on his end and left mewith an open line. Now I was extremely upset with him because if this is your supervisor this was poor/horrible service.   I have been with Verizon for 20+ years.

Tried troubleshooting with switching LTE on and off, going back and forth between 3G to LTE, all with turning phones completely off and resetting to on with each experiment between different settings. Cell boasters inside the homes is not an option when our plow drivers or firemen and police officers are outside trying to open all our neighborhood gates that are operated by cell calls. The plow drivers and residents and public safety officers are all on different devises and they all having the same problems if they have Verizon but not if they have AT&T.  For example yesterday I stood before a gate and called the gate and the call went through and the gate opened. Three minutes later I did the same thing from the same position With the same phone and the call would not go through. This particular gate is in direct line of sight of your cell towers. I changed my position in relationship to the gate about ten times and repeatedly I got the same results- sometimes the calls went through and other times the calls did not.  We, all the community who are with Verizon are having this problem   And we all have never had this problem before in these outside locations. Those people in my survey that are with AT&T are not having this problem.  Thus devices are not the issue.   There are three places within our canyon at the lower part of the canyon that all service providers have dropped calls on a consistent basis since cell phones have been around through the years but the gates and neighborhoods in the upper part of the canyon are the areas that have been reliable for the past 12 years with Verizon are the areas where we have just recently had problems.   Some Verizon customers in this area started having problems 1 1/2 years ago but since September the problem has exponentially become totally unreliable by all the Verizon customers both in their houses and especially outside. Many people have purchased cell boosters, others like myself rely on WiFi for calls inside my house fir this past 6 months. But like I said that doesn't help outside.

We have 2 prepaid Verizon phones.  Both are up-to-date as to payments with no additional payment due until the end of January.  The one phone, this morning, has no service.  The other is working fine.  In speaking with your representatives, we were told, after every attempt they could make to get it to work, that the phone model is simply ""obsolete"" or, in their words, ""retired"" since Verizon has migrated service to 5G.  We were informed that the same may happen, at any time, to the other phone.  The only solution offered was to purchase new phones.  They needed to be, in the exact words of the representatives, phones that are listed as 4G LTE.  Interestingly, both of our phone have EXACTLY THAT printed on them and do their SIM cards - (they are LG Zone 3).  Needless to say, we were not informed of this potential problem in advance by your company.  Interestingly, Verizon can easily text us with notices when our payment is due, but they cannot inform us of a potential loss of service.  And, all of this in the midst of a pandemic!  We could, potentially, be without any phone service, through no fault of our own.  Our bill is paid.  The phones are listed as 4G LTE, which we are told is what is needed by your representative, but one has no service and the other could lose it at any time.  The solution offered by your representative is to purchase new telephones.  An offer was made of a credit to our account for purchase of new phones, but still this would require an out-of-pocket expense until the credit appears.  It also requires us to go out, in the midst of a pandemic and lockdown, to visit a Verizon store that is 20+ miles away.  And, the earliest available appointment is not until Tuesday.  Now, understand, no phone service without any advance warning and the potential for the other phone to ""die"" at any time; an unexpected out-of-pocket expense; an unplanned trip 20+ miles; prepaying for service that we are do not have; 3 hours of our valuable time spend your representatives without any restoration of service and the guidance to ""buy"".......all of this through NO FAULT of our ours.  In addition, the one phone actually has a landline work phone being forwarded to it, because of the pandemic.  If this is loss, it will be a much greater potential problem.  And, through all of his, Verizon's solution is a small credit.  How about pro-rating our service for the time we are losing?  How about an actual apology for our loss of time and our inconvenience?  I am sure that other arrangements could be made.  If not, perhaps a visit to another carrier is in order!",FACEBOOK_14_10164673597065123_10164673768050123,POST_4375619694,Brenda,Brenda Zacher,Verizon,,"So long as the devices are not 3G, there shouldn't be an issue to troubleshoot.
